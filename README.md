# Cedar Grove Palette Fader

### _A work-in-progress CircuitPython displayio color palette and color list brightness setting and normalizer tool._

## Overview

The PaletteFader class was originally developed for the RGB LED matrix of the Adafruit MatrixPortal due to the lack of hardware support for display brightness. The class should be compatible with any displayio graphics application. 

This repo currently consists of an example using the PaletteFader class.
